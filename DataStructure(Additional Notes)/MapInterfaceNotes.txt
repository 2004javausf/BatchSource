Map Interface
	
	Is an object that maps 'keys' to 'values' (also known as a dictionary in other languages). Each key has to be unique and can be mapped to only 
	one value, note that a key can be mapped to duplicate values. 

	Methods for basic operations:
		put, get, remove, containsKey, contiansValue, size and empty
	Bulk Operations:
		putAll, clear 
	Collection Views:
		keySet, entrySet and values.

	Classes:
		HashMap: (Uses a technique called "Hashing" to map large string to short string, helps in indexing and searching)
			Allows duplicate values, not duplicate keys 
			Allows a single null key and multiple null values
			Does not guarantee order (and unsynchronized compared to HashTable)

		TreeMap:
			Does not allow null keys, but does allow null values
			Sorted according to the natural ordering of the keys

		LinkedHashMap:
			Very similar to a HashMap, but it maintains insertion order 
	
You cannot iterate over the Map objects, like you would from the Collection interface:
	You will have to iterate over the key set (.keySet()), value set (.valueSet()) or the entry set (.entrySet()).
