Why there is no function in java?
    Java only have methods. Methods is belong to class or object.

Four OOP
The four pillars of OOP:




Inheritance
    when a programming language allows for a hierarchy of objects.
    Child objects obtain states and behaviors from parent objects
    Multiple inheritance??? NO! (kinda yes with interfaces)
 
    is-a relationship
 
 **Diamond problem**

Encapsulation
    when you wrap and protect data fields, preventing manipulation outside of the class.
    Usually require getter and setter methods to change these values.
    Conceal internal state of object. Preserving intergrity.
    "Getter" and "Setter" action

Polymorphism
    the ability for the programming language to be able to tell the difference between objects and methods of the same names with different variable/class types.

    "overriding": same method name, same parameters, different behavior.
                  Final *Something for us*
    "overloading": same name, different parameters, different behavior.
                   happens at compile-time
    Yes, many forms- :/
    Multiple "is-a" relationships
    Object>Animals>Cat
    Animal IS-a Animal, and also an Object
    Cat is a cat, animal and object
    Covariance

Abstraction (sometime it might considered as Encapsulation)---BlackBox
    sometimes omitted from pillars of OOP
    Hiding the implementation details
    "what it does, NOT how it does it"
    Exposing only functionality
    Abstract Class-abstract methods have no implementation
